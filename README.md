# Example git repository

This is a very simple git repository to let your team experiment with branches
and merging.

The file you are looking at is `README.md`; by default GitHub will show the
contents of this file if it exists. It is written in Markdown, an easy language
for formatting text. (This is what Discord uses for formatting too, by the
way!) There's a summary of Markdown formatting
[on markdown.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

# Activity steps

To get some practice on using git with your team, follow these steps.

## 1. Clone the repository

Everyone on your team should clone this repository so that all of you have a
local copy of it.

## 2. Add files

Each team member should add a new file (different from teammates' files), then
commit and push it. (Since your teammates are making changes in the repository
concurrently, everyone after the first will likely need to fetch and pull to
get teammates' contributions before you are able to push their own.)

## 3. Make a new branch

In GitHub, each team member should make their own branch named after themself.
In the local repository, fetch, pull, and checkout to switch to your own
branch. Then **edit the two lines below** (in `README.md`) to add your own
favorite color and name to the list.

> Our team's favorite colors are: (insert colors here)
> 
> Students who have completed this part: (insert names here)

Commit and push the changes to your own branch.

## 4. Merge branches

Someone (probably the git maven for your team) should then merge all teammates'
branches back into the main branch. Since everyone should have been changing
the same line in this file (`README.md`), some merge conflicts will need to be
resolved! You should end with everyone's favorite colors and names together in
this file.
