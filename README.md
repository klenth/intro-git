# Example git repository

This is a very simple git repository to let your team experiment with branches
and merging.

The file you are looking at is `README.md`; by default GitHub will show the
contents of this file if it exists. It is written in Markdown, an easy language
for formatting text. (This is what Discord uses for formatting too, by the
way!) There's a summary of Markdown formatting
[on markdown.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
